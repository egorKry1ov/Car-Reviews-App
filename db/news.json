If that visual seems vaguely familiar, it may be because this seller has used it in previous BaT sales—for a 36,000-mile '78 280Z that brought $61,000 back in October and a remarkable 355-mile 1976 280Z that went for $140,000 in November."

It seems every other day another automaker is parading its plans to transition to an entirely electric lineup by the end of the decade. Today it's Aston Martin's turn. To no one's surprise, the company is targeting 2030 as the expiration date of new models with internal-combustion engines. Of course, there's a chance it'll still build gas-burning special editions outside its core lineup. Besides that predictable announcement, though, Aston also says it'll launch its first electric model by 2025."

But this changed when the Gallardo arrived in 2003—the junior V-10 supercar sold just over 14,000 units during a ten-year production run. This blew its predecessor, the V-8–powered Jalpa, out of the water, with only 410 Jalpas being sold between 1981 and 1988. But the Gallardo’s follow-up, the Huracán, has proved even more successful, and Lamborghini announced on Thursday that it has built the 20,000th example of the V-10–powered supercar that entered production in 2014."

The Volkswagen ID.4, Ford Mustang Mach-E, and Tesla Model Y are becoming increasingly commonplace sights on American roads, and they've been recently joined by the Kia EV6 and its sharp-looking crosstown rival, the 2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5. Sharp turns out to be a particularly apt description of the Hyundai's distinctly creased styling, which features the mark of Zorro on its flanks, pixelated Minecraft detailing, and a chunky stance that benefits from an uncommonly long wheelbase, with stubby overhangs and sizable wheels pushed out nearly flush with the fenders. It's refreshing to see a unique take on the two-box crossover shape, but is there more to the Ioniq 5 than fresh-faced smart looks?"

Now Bugatti has revealed two more of its Sur Mesure creations, another Chiron Pur Sport and a Chiron Super Sport hand-painted to mimic the way, as Bugatti puts it, 'the precisely designed body panels of the marque's hyper sports cars reflect light.'"

The Judge is a special example of a muscle car from the late '60s. Just like the current owner of this 1969 GTO Judge, I also received mine by way of my father, who spent his summers in college working at the plant in Pontiac doing various jobs. One summer he worked in the iron foundry shoveling molding sand, one summer in the assembly line plant on the chassis line, and his last in the finishing plant adjusting headlights and prepping for shipping. It seems only fitting that he ended up with a GTO one day himself."

As a presentation, it wasn't subtle, but it was certainly in keeping with the theme of the presentation: light, transparency, and electricity. Lincoln president Joy Falotico says that by 2025 the brand will offer three new electric vehicles, with a goal of half its global volume being EVs before 2030. The Lincoln Star concept—again, not so much with the subtlety on that name, but we appreciate the point—was created to showcase Lincoln's approach to design and experience on an electric platform."
